### Part 3: System Design and Automation Strategy (15 minutes)

**Task:** Design a system that automates the following scenario:
- Your company has several internal applications, and each generates log files. These logs must be periodically collected, processed (e.g., error logs should be flagged), and stored in a central location. Design an automation solution that:
  - Retrieves the log files from multiple servers.
  - Flags any errors found in the logs.
  - Automatically backs up and archives the logs to an internal system or cloud storage.
  - Optionally: Consider using CI/CD practices to ensure the automation runs smoothly.
The candidate can describe this solution verbally or with diagrams.
